# 🌐 Online Learning Platform – SDE Intern Project

Welcome! This repository showcases my journey in building a modern online learning platform as part of the SDE Intern hiring process. The project combines **full-stack engineering, user-centric design, and security-first practices** to deliver a polished experience for both students and instructors.

---

## 🚀 Features & Highlights

### Two Roles, Tailored Experience
**Instructors** can create courses with rich content, including:
* Readings
* Quizzes (multiple-choice)
* Rich text descriptions (via TipTap editor)
* File uploads (images, PDFs) using drag-and-drop Uploader component

**Students** can:
* Browse available courses
* Complete lectures sequentially
* Attempt quizzes with real-time grading
* Track their progress (X/Y lectures completed)

### Sleek Interface
* Built with **Shadcn UI** for a clean, responsive design
* Animated elements (`animate-spin`) for feedback and modern feel
* Theme toggle (light/dark) for accessibility and aesthetics

### Instant Feedback
* Real-time quiz grading
* Toast notifications via **Sonner** for actions and errors
* File upload errors handled gracefully with toast messages

### Secure from the Start
* Authentication and role-based authorization with **Better Auth**
* API security with **Arcjet** (sliding window rate limiting)

### Type Safety & Performance
* **T3 Env** ensures environment variables are validated at compile-time
* **Prisma ORM** + **Neon Postgres** for reliable and scalable database management
* Forms validated with **Zod** and **React Hook Form**

    cd ScalarLMS_assignment
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```
3.  **Configure `.env` according to T3 Env guidelines:**
    ```
    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<user>:<password>@<host>/<db>
    BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=your-secret
    ARCJET_API_KEY=your-key
    NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
    ```
4.  **Setup Prisma DB:**
